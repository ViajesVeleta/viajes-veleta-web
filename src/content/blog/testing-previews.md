# Testing Previews

This is a new blog post created to test the automated preview deployment system using **Cloudflare Workers Assets** and **GitHub Actions**.

## How it works

1.  A new PR is created.
2.  GitHub Actions triggers the `Preview Web` workflow.
3.  The project is built and deployed to a unique Worker name.
4.  A link is provided in the GitHub Job Summary.

If you are reading this on a preview URL, then the system is working perfectly! 🚀
